# aws-batch-shiny-orchestration-app
A Proof of Concept workflow for using Shiny Server applications as an orchestration and monitoring dashboard for triggering AWS Batch jobs 


This repository contains the sample Dockerfile and Shiny Application used as a live demo for discussions during my keynote presentation at American University's Winter Data Science Institute

This workflow is a proof of concept designed to demonstrate the power of AWS Batch. This workflow mirrors a system I've designed for my firm that allows for the running of dozens of various analytics jobs using a Shiny app as the orchestration layer. 

This demo also showcases integration with AWS S3, Google Sheets, and Slack webhooks for notification, parameters, and alerts.
